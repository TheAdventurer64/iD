# Development Roadmap

iD is a sizable project with many types of changes happening concurrently. In the past, it's been difficult to tell at a glance what to expect next and what we're broadly working toward. The [iD Blog](https://ideditor.blog/) is one place to get information, but the format doesn't lend itself to dynamic technical content.

This roadmap aims to get everyone on the same page by outlining the general initiatives and specific goals for iD over the short, intermediate, and long terms. These should be considered only as guidelines, not a strict set of deliverables.

The roadmap should be kept aligned with the needs of the OpenStreetMap database itself, its ecosystem of software, and the supporting community.
